## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting flight delays to optimize airport operations.
The main goal is to develop a predictive model that can forecast delays as early as possible, enabling airlines and airports to:

Improve passenger experience

Reduce operational costs

Optimize scheduling and resource allocation

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is flights.csv, containing 71,175 flight records with the following columns:

Column	Description
flight_id	Unique identifier for each flight
airline	Airline code (e.g., MM, YE, BZ)
aircraft_type	Type of aircraft (e.g., Airbus A320, Embraer E175)
schengen	Indicates if the flight is Schengen or non-Schengen
origin	Origin airport code
arrival_time	Scheduled arrival time
departure_time	Scheduled departure time
day	Day of the year
year	Year of the flight
is_holiday	Boolean indicating if the flight was on a holiday
delay	Actual delay in minutes (target variable)

## 📊 Key Findings
Data Exploration
Dataset contains 71,175 flights from 2010 to 2022.

Average delay: 12.55 minutes.

Standard deviation: 23.13 minutes.

Some flights arrived earlier than scheduled (negative delays).

Visual Insights
Average Delay by Airline: Significant differences in delay times across airlines.

Number of Flights by Airline: Uneven distribution, with airline BZ operating the majority of flights.
